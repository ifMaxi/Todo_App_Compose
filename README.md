# Todo App Compose

My first little app created with kotlin and the jetpack compose framework.

### Description

I have created a simple TODO app that creates, saves and deletes items (tasks) to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the codelabs of the [basic android course with jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) up to unit 6.

## What I used to create this app

- The Kotlin language
- Jetpack Compose for the UI
- Material Design 3
- Room for the database
- Flow
- Manual dependency injection
- Compose navigation
- ViewModel
